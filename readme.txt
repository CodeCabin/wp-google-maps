== Description ==

The easiest to use Google Maps, Leaflet and Open Layers Map Plugin (including a Map Block)!

Add a customized Google map, map block or Store Locator to your WordPress posts and/or pages quickly and easily with the supplied shortcode. No fuss. No iFrames and super easy to use! Perfect for contact page maps, routes, maps showing delivery areas and any other use you can think of!

While the free version of WP Go Maps allows you to create a Google map with as many markers as you like, the Pro version allows you to do so much more! 

Create Elementor Maps, map blocks and map widgets easily with our WP Go Maps Elementor map block integration, straight out the box!
