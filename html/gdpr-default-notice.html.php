Some visual components of WP Google Maps use 3rd party libraries which are loaded over the network. At present the libraries are Google Maps, Open Street Map, jQuery DataTables and FontAwesome. When loading resources over a network, the 3rd party server will receive your IP address and User Agent string amongst other details. Please refer to the Privacy Policy of the respective libraries for details on how they use data and the process to exercise your rights under the GDPR regulations.

WP Google Maps uses jQuery DataTables to display sortable, searchable tables, such as that seen in the Advanced Marker Listing and on the Map Edit Page. jQuery DataTables in certain circumstances uses a cookie to save and later recall the "state" of a given table - that is, the search term, sort column and order and current page. This data is help in local storage and retained until this is cleared manually. No libraries used by WP Google Maps transmit this information.

Please <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/terms">see here</a> and <a href="https://maps.google.com/help/terms_maps.html">here</a> for Google\'s terms. Please also see <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB&amp;gl=uk">Google\'s Privacy Policy</a>. We do not send the API provider any personally identifying information, or information that could uniquely identify your device.

Where this notice is displayed in place of a map, agreeing to this notice will store a cookie recording your agreement so you are not prompted again.',
